# RecipesApi

Needs a lot (A LOT) of improvment. 

Too slow, probably because it has an API that uses another Api, so an API inception going on that brings vulnerabilities.
Also want to personalize it, as well

Mostly this was done to try to understand how a REACT Api works, the basics, etc which I found good enough, but still need to learn more about security issues the two apis in one done in this exercise are.

If anyone is willing to help or point good content I'll be really greatful!
