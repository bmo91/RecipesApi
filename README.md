# RecipesApi

Needs a lot (and I mean: A LOT) of improvment.

a) Bootstrap and other dependecies bring potential security vulnerabilities, so please be carefull when using the code;
b) Is an API that uses another API;
c) Too slow in rendering (see above bullet points to know why);

Also want to personalize it, as well

Mostly this was done to try and understand how a REACT Api works, the basics, etc which I found good enough, but still need to learn more about security issues the two apis in one (as done in this guided exercise) are.

If anyone is willing to help or point good content I'll be really greatful!
